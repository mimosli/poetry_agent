### 1. Full 15-second script (spoken or text overlay)

**[Text Overlay:]**  
Time slips through our fingers like sand,  
Moments we chase, yet they never last.  
**[Cue Clips of Laughter]**  
We’re lost in the joy,  
**[Cue Clips of Tears]**  
Or caught in the sorrow,  
**[Cue Clips of Contemplation]**  
Eyeing the horizon, hoping tomorrow.  
**[Time-lapse of Sunset]**  
Like sunsets that fade,  
**[Time-lapse of Cityscape]**  
We dance through the waves,  
**[Final Text Overlay:]**  
Embrace the fleeting — it's all we have.
